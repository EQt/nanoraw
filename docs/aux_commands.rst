Auxiliary Commands
******************

write_most_significant
----------------------

Write sequence where signal differs the most significantly between two groups. This is the same as the `--sequences-filename` output from the `plot_most_significant` but does not require that all regions be plotted and thus can be much faster for the selection of a large nuber of regions. This is suggested for running downstream motif discovery pipelines.

write_wiggle
------------

Write wiggle file of genome coverage from `genome_resquiggle` mappings. Other wiggles comming soon.
